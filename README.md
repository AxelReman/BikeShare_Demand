# Supervised Machine Learning Project

## Project Description

In this supervised machine learning project, I will be selecting a new data set and conducting a comprehensive analysis using various supervised ML techniques. The main focus of this project is to practice the ML workflow and gain proficiency in implementing supervised ML models with new data. To ensure a smooth ML workflow, it is essential to select a dataset suitable for ML techniques, allowing me to directly dive into the ML process.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:

Enhance my autonomy in the supervised ML code and workflow.
Practice understanding the predictions of supervised ML models and their potential solutions to real-world problems.
Practice clear communication of the value of my analysis and code.
Publish the project on GitHub.

## Project Guidelines

To successfully complete this project, I will follow these guidelines:

Choose or collect a suitable data set for the supervised ML task.
Describe the data set and formulate a precise problem that I aim to solve.
Determine whether the problem requires classification or regression.
Plan the project using a Trello Board for effective project management.

## Technical Requirements

To meet the project goals and guidelines, I will adhere to the following technical requirements:

Define the target variable and independent variables (features) for the ML task.
Identify the metric that I will optimize my model for.
Establish a baseline performance that I aim to surpass with my model.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Preprocess the input data as necessary:
Scale the features.
Create dummy variables if categorical features are present.
Handle missing data through imputation.
Perform model selection by trying out at least four different ML models.
Utilize K-fold cross-validation during model evaluation.
Conduct hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV with a parameter grid and K-fold cross-validation.
Once the final model is selected, make predictions on the test data.
Note: The model should not be modified after using it to predict the test data.
Evaluate the final model's performance on the test data and compare it against the established baseline.

## Presentation

The presentation for this project should be a maximum of 5 minutes. The slides should include the following components (not necessarily in this order):

Title of the project and the name of the student.
Clear description of the problem I am aiming to solve using supervised ML techniques.
Clear description of the data set used in the project.
Effective communication of the models' performance, comparing them to the baseline.
Clear explanation of how the models' predictions can create value and solve the problem at hand.
Challenges encountered during the project.
Key learnings and highlights from the project.
